                Back for another year, every night, the Sunny Acres Corn Maze
                becomes the Sunny Acres Haunted Maze. This season's maze begins
                with an encounter with an evil organist (played by the Council
                Bluff Choir's own Glenn Frye). Explore the maze and find the
                zombie graveyard, the pumpkin tower, and a haunted house made of
                corn, not to mention the spiders, ghosts, witches, and other
                assorted villainy that inhabit the maze.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Haunted Maze is open the last three weekends of October with
                a special event on Halloween. Come early in the day to explore
                the larger Corn Maze, stay for a homemade meal of brats and
                burgers, soda, and chips, and then participate in the Halloween
                Festival. Special stations will be set up in the Haunted Maze
                for trick-or-treaters. A smaller maze is also available that is
                "scare-friendly" for younger children.

            Of course, Sunny Acres is above all, a farm. Our Farm Shop is always
            open with reasonable prices and great produce. Save even more money
            by picking your own fruits and vegetables from our orchards and
            gardens.
          </p>
          <p>We all hope to see you soon, down on the farm.</p>
